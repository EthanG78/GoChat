**What is it?**</br>
This is an online chat written entirely in GO.</br>
Whilst using the amazingly crafted _Gorilla Mux_ library.</br>

**Installing**
First you must have `Golang v1.2` or later installed on your system with a working workspace.</br>
Next you must `go get github.com/EthanG78/golang_chat`.</br>
This will locate the source files into your Go workspace</br>
Next simply use the command line and `CD` into the golang_chat directory.</br>
Once in the directory, simply `go run main.go` this will start a local instance of the server at the address `localhost:8080`.</br>

**What is to come?**
Upon completion I will host this app on google's AppEngine for public use.</br>

**Currently Integrated functions**</br>
`Login`</br>
`User Database`</br>
`Chat functionality`</br>
`Websocket routing`</br>
`UUID/HMAC SHA256 encrytion`</br>
`GOHTML webpage integration`</br>
_With more to come_
