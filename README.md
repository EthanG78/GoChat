**Downloading app**
If you wish to run the web app from your machine without downloading the source simply</br>
download the binary of the latest version.</br>

**Installing**
First you must have `Golang v1.2` or later installed on your system with a working workspace.</br>
Download the directory through a terminal `go get github.com/EthanG78/GoChat`.</br>
This will download the source files into your Go workspace</br>
Next simply `CD` to the GoChat directory.</br>
Once in the directory, simply `go run main.go` this will start a local instance of the server at the address `localhost:8080`.</br>

**What is to come?**
For months now I have been releasing several alpha versions, the end of January will mark the first Beta release!</br>
Upon completion I will host this app on google's AppEngine for public use.</br>

**Currently Integrated functions**</br>
`Login and sign-up`</br>
`User Database`</br>
`Chat functionality`</br>
`Websocket routing`</br>
`Bcrypt encryption`</br>
`GOHTML webpage integration`</br>
`Go themed styling`</br>
